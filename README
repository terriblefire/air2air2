Written by Stephen Leary & Donald Macleod circ xmas 1994

Music by Stephen Leary & Donald Macleod.

I wrote/cloned this came in over the xmas period in 1994 with Donald Macleod (who sadly passed in June 2018). We were kids and played this to death. 

Maybe someone will enjoy it .

The original graphics were ripped out of an old STOS game. 

Will build on any system with vasmm68k_mot installed. Originally written in devpac 2.
